# SD Webui Memory Release
This is an Extension for the [Automatic1111 Webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui), which *attempts to* clean up memory after each generation.

### But Why?
- A few Reddit posts/comments mentioned that CUDA sometimes can cause memory issues/leaks. This Extension *tries to* solve that by calling `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` after each generation.

### Features
- Perform `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` and `gc.collect()` after every generation automatically
- Add a `ðŸ§¹` button that triggers the cleanup manually
